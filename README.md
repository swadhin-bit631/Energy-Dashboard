# Energy-Dashboard

‚ö° Energy Meter Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project
A Power BI dashboard to analyze energy consumption patterns using real-time meter data. This project focuses on evaluating electrical parameters like energy usage, voltage, current, power factor, and total harmonic distortion (THD).

üîç Key Insights & Metrics
Total Energy Consumption: 109.91K kWh tracked across the timeframe.

Voltage & Current Relationship: Analyzed using distribution and scatter plots.

Power Factor: Monitored with an average of 0.97 (indicates efficiency).

THD (%): Identified maximum Total Harmonic Distortion ‚Äî critical for power quality.

Energy by Time of Day: Consumption patterns segmented by Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.

Reactive Power Impact: Correlation between Active Power and Reactive Power (kVAR).
